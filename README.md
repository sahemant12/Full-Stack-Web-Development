1. `CDN(content delivery network)` : The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other media, to end-users quickly and efficiently.
2. `Jsx(JavaScript syntax extension)` : JSX provides an easy way to write HTML in React and easy to create templates. It is a kind of function that returns a object that React can interpret and used to create actual element. 
E.g: 
const element = <h1 className="header">This is JSX</h1>
console.log(element)
/* output
{
    type: "h1", 
    key: null, 
    ref: null, 
    props: {
        className: "header", 
        children: "This is JSX"
    }, 
    _owner: null, 
    _store: {}
}
